# Cosmos

A system for processing, storing, and sharing data.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)

### Setup

Create an isolated environment for development:

```shell
poetry env use </path/to/python/interpreter>
```

Install the project in edit mode for development:

```shell
poetry install
```

Open an interactive shell session in the development environment:

```shell
poetry shell
```

> **Note**: All commands which rely on installed packages will assume that you are
> working from an interactive shell session. If you are not, you will need to
> prefix those commands with `poetry run`.
